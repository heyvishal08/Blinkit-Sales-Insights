## 🔍 Problem Statement

India's quick commerce platforms like Blinkit generate **massive volumes of retail data**, but much of it remains **underutilized**. The challenge?

> *“What if every sale, outlet, and product could tell a story — and that story could guide business growth?”*

That’s the spark that led to this project: a **unified dashboard** that blends **key KPIs**, **consumer trends**, and **actionable insights** into a single analytics experience.

## 🧠 My Approach

This project isn’t just visual — it’s **strategic**. Here's how I built it from scratch:

- 🧹 **Data Wrangling & Cleaning**  
  - Cleaned and preprocessed large CSV files using **Python (Pandas, NumPy)**
  - Removed duplicates, handled missing values, formatted timestamps

- 🧱 **Data Modeling**  
  - Connected **MySQL** to **Power BI**
  - Created relational models to allow cross-filtering between stores, SKUs, and categories

- 📊 **Data Visualization & Storytelling**  
  - Developed interactive charts for:
    - Sales by Category, Outlet Type, and Year
    - Average Order Value (AOV)
    - Customer Ratings
    - SKU performance (top and underperforming)
  - Used DAX for calculated KPIs and embedded recommendations

- 🎨 **Design & Usability**  
  - Applied dark-themed visuals with emoji-coded tiles
  - Used tooltips, slicers, and insight layers for interactive storytelling
